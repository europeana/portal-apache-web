# Apache virtualhost templates

This directory contains templates for Apache virtualhosts.

These are not intended to be used as-is, but to be copied into the directory
conf/vhosts by deployment scripts, and adapted for a particular virtualhost in
that deployment environment.

See documentation in each template for description of their intended purpose,
and deployment instructions.

## Templates

1. [portal-alt-vhost.conf](portal-alt-vhost.conf): alternate portal host template
2. [redirect-host-to-url.conf](redirect-host-to-url.conf): redirect all requests to one URL
